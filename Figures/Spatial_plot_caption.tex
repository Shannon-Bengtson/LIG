Panels a and b: Global distribution of benthic foraminifera $\delta^{13}$C during the Holocene (a) and LIG (b). Size indicates the number of values per core, and colour indicates the average $\delta^{13}$C value.Four specific regions are highlighted during the Holocene and LIG: equatorial Pacific (white, grey), equatorial Atlantic (yellow, green), southeast Atlantic (cyan, blue), and northeast Atlantic (magenta, red). Panel c: box plots for each region (box colours correspond to the region outline colours). Orange vertical lines show the median.
