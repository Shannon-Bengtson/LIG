The north-south profile of the Atlantic Ocean benthic $\delta^{13}$C. Panel a, Holocene (red) and LIG (blue) core average $\delta^{13}C$ (points) and end-members (stars). Dotted lines are the moving averages of the cores. Solid lines are the statistical model $\delta^{13}$C results at 2000m. Panel b represents the core average $\delta^{13}$C as a fraction of the end-members; at a value of one, the core is equal to the NADW end-member and at a value of 0, the core is equal to the AABW end-member.
