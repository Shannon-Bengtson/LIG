Reconstruction of 2-dimensional $\delta^{13}$C ($\permil$) during the Holocene and LIG of depth with latitude for the Atlantic Ocean. The points represent the proxy data, showing the average $\delta^{13}$C with colour and size indicating the number of points. Contours show the reconstructed $\delta^{13}$C.
