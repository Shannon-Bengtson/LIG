Benthic foraminifera $\delta^{13}$C (left y-axis, $\permil$) during the Holocene and LIG for four defined regions; North East Atlantic (a, b) , Equatorial Atlantic (c, d), Southeast Atlantic (e, f) , and Equatorial Pacific (g, h). Data is presented in discrete time slices spanning 1000 years, only including cores deeper than 2500m. Circular, transparent points connected by lines are individual proxies. Black points represent $\delta^{13}$C averages per slice. Each slice has a corresponding averaged depth (right y-axis, m), with 1 standard deviation either side shown in the bars. Slices with an average depth within $\pm$300m of the mean core depth of all slices are represented with a square point. Slices with an average depth shallower than 300m are shown in a upward triangle, and deeper than 300m are shown in a downward triangle. Shading shows 1 standard deviation either side of the mean for slices where more than 1 point exists.
